# Computer Performance and Benchmarks

## Benchmarks

### Benchmark programs

* Benchmark - Program used to evaluate performance
* Benchmark Suite - set of Benchmark programs

### 5 types of programs used to evaluate performance

* Real Applications
 * portability is tricky 
* Modified / Scripting Applications
 * enhanced portability
 * narrowing focus to a specific subset of the performance spectrum
* Kernels
 * small, but key pieces from real programs
 * known examples: livermore loops or linpack
* Toy benchmarks
 * sort algorithms
 * sieve of eratosthenes
* Synthetic benchmarks
 * typical instruction mixes, i.e: 40% x, 30% y
 * whetstone and drystone
 
### Benchmark Suites

* Benchmark Suite = Collection of benchmarks
* Most successful standardization attempt
 * SPEC (Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation)
 * focuses mainly on CPU performance
* Current generation: CPU2006
 * 12 integer benchmarks
 * 17 floating point benchmarks
