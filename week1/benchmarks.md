# Computer Performance and Benchmarks

## Benchmarks

* Benchmark - Program used to evaluate performance
* Benchmark Suite - set of Benchmark programs

# 5 types of programs used to evaluate performance

* Real Applications
 * portability is tricky 
* Modified / Scripting Applications
 * enhanced portability
 * narrowing focus to a specific subset of the performance spectrum
* Kernels
 * Small, but key pieces from real programs
 * Known examples: livermore loops or linpack
* Toy benchmarks
 * Sort algorithms
 * Sieve of Eratosthenes
* Synthetic benchmarks
 * Typical instruction mixes, i.e: 40% x, 30% y
 * whetstone and drystone
