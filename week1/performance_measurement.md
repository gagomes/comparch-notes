# Computer Performance and Benchmarks

## Performance Measurement

### Time

* Response time / latency / execution time
  * Time between start and completion of event / task / program (n seconds)
* Throughput / Rate
  * Rate of processing work (n jobs / second)

### Other Aspects

* Availability
* Scalability
* Performance per watt

### Measuring time

* Wallclock AKA elapsed time
* Multiprogrammed AKA processes are preempted if waiting on IO, time slice is up, etc.
